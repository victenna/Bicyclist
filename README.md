We present python Pygame Mini Project for kids. This project uses Bicyclist Class. Class is a mechanism to organize your
code into generic, reusable pieces of code. Classes are great when you need to represent a collection of attributes and
methods that will be used repeatedly with little or no modification. The benefit of using class here is that we can create
objects: bicyclist images which are able to perfectly satisfy specific needs. In our case we build a few cyclists-objects
from one code class template structure. Each cyclist-object has its own properties: location on the screen, man or woman,
who rides a bike and bike speed. This simple example consists of 5 bicyclist-objects and can be easily explained for kids 
who learn Python language. Files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
